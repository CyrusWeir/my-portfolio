Each recipe also includes the possibility to create and submit ingredients that are incorporated into the database for use by the community. This project incorporates a full CRUD/BREAD-style set of actions, and could be adapted to a wide range of community based websites, or for commercial purposes.\n\nThis project was realised in a group setting with 3 other budding developers, in an agile work environment. Our workflow consisted of both peer-reviewed and overseeing developer-reviewed pull requests, and daily and weekly reviews and check-ins.",
